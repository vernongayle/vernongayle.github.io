I am Professor of Sociology and Social Statistics at the University of Edinburgh. 

My main substantive research interests include social stratification, the sociology of youth and the sociology of education. 

My main methodological interests include the analysis of large-scale and complex social science datasets, 
statistical modelling, longitudinal data, administrative social science data, missing data methods, transparent social research and 
reproducibility, computational social research, and data science.

I have written on topics as diverse as migration, subjective well being, populations, fertility and digital social research, and 
I am interested in the sociology of sport.
